- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login functionality.
  - (Located in `lib/features/authentication/`)
- **Transaction Management:** Easily add, edit, and view income and expense transactions.
  - (Located in `lib/features/transactions/`)
- **Budgeting:** Create and manage budgets for different spending categories.
  - (Located in `lib/features/budgets/`)
- **Account Management:** Manage user profile and linked accounts (if applicable).
  - (Located in `lib/features/account/`)
- **Group Spending (if applicable):** Functionality to manage shared expenses within groups.
  - (Located in `lib/features/groups/`)
- **Home Dashboard:** An overview of financial status, recent transactions, and budget progress.
  - (Located in `lib/features/home/`)
- **Application Settings:** Customize app preferences, notifications, and themes.
  - (Located in `lib/features/settings/`)

## Tech Stack & Architecture

Monie is built with a modern tech stack and follows a robust architectural pattern:

- **Language:** [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- **Framework:** [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture
  - **Presentation Layer:** Manages UI and user interaction (Widgets, BLoCs/Cubits, Pages).
  - **Domain Layer:** Contains business logic (Entities, Use Cases, Repository Interfaces).
  - **Data Layer:** Handles data retrieval and storage (Repositories, Data Sources, Models).
- **State Management:** BLoC / Cubit (evident from `bloc` subdirectories in features).
- **Dependency Injection:** Using `get_it` (inferred from `lib/di/injection.dart` and `injection_container.dart`).
- **Routing:** (Specify your routing solution here, e.g., GoRouter, AutoRoute, or Flutter's Navigator 2.0)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Asset Management:** Utilizes Flutter's asset system, with generated asset references in `lib/gen/assets.gen.dart`.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (Ensure you have a version compatible with the project, e.g., 3.x.x)

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    This project uses a `.env` file for managing sensitive information and environment-specific configurations, particularly for Supabase. - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project. - Add your Supabase URL and Anon Key:
    `env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
`
    _Note: The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to version control._

### Running the App
